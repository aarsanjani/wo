    "- Latest version - The open source XGBoost algorithm typically supports a more recent version of XGBoost. To see the XGBoost version that is currently supported, see XGBoost SageMaker Estimators and Models.\n",
    "- Flexibility - Take advantage of the full range of XGBoost functionality, such as cross-validation support. You can add custom pre- and post-processing logic and run additional code after training.\n",
    "- Scalability - The XGBoost open source algorithm has a more efficient implementation of distributed training, which enables it to scale out to more instances and reduce out-of-memory errors.\n",
